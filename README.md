- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gaspigz, a student from Argentina who is devoted to programming and the web disign. I like dogs too!
  I have knowledge about C (the one I'm best at), Python, PHP, SQL, and improving in JS. Besides, I like HTML and CSS too!
  Now, IÂ´m in my last year in Insituto PolitÃ©cnico Superior, in the specialty of computer science. IÂ´ll study the career of Computer Cs in UNR. Moreover, I keep studying with online courses,
  in webs like Udemy, Youtube, etc. (Here is where I learned more).
  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on backend projects, learn he best practices of JS, and grow up as a programmer.
